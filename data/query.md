# Citation and Altmetric database query
We extracted citation data from [Scopus](https://www.scopus.com/search/form.uri?display=basic). We searched all Articles and Reviews published between 2007-2016 containing the term 'climat* change' in the Title, Keywords, or Abstract. We only considered [journals that frequently published climate change studies](climate_journals.csv) (>100 studies published between 2007-2016, n = 116).

We extracted news, twitter and policy mentions from [Altmetric](https://www.altmetric.com/). We filtered the Altmetric explorer database using Scopus DOIs.
